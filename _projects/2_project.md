In my research of computer science I learned about a prominent figure named John Conway and a cellular automation he called "The Game of Life". I began experimenting with the game of life and eventually wanted to create my own game of life, so I did.

The Game of Life lives in a grid of sqaures called cells, each cell has 4 adjacent neighbors which can either be alive or dead. In each step of The Game of Life, the following transactions occur:
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Here is my implementation of this facinating simulation:
