Hello! My name is Ben Lance and I am a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer science. I am interested in persuing a career in software engineering where I can solve interesting problems using creative solutions. I have had two internships; one in software engineering, and one in machine learning. These opportunities have allowed me to learn a lot about agile development, good software design practices, development lifecycle, team communication, and more.

Feel free to reach out to me at any time
